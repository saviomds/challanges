# challange 1

    To run :

    ~ node arrayMap.js


    Let's break down the problem:

    Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the start of the array.
    Move the right pointer, adding elements to the current sum.
    If the current sum exceeds the target, move the left pointer until the sum is within the target.
    If the sum equals the target at any point, return True.
    If the right pointer reaches the end of the array and the sum is not found, return False.

# challange 2

    To run :

    ~ node stringTransform.js

    Let's break down the problem:

    If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
    If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
    If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
